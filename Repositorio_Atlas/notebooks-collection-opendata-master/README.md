# ATLAS Open Data

## notebooks-collection-opendata
A set of multiple notebooks using 8 TeV and 13 TeV ATLAS Open Data datasets

To execute in MyBinder:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/atlas-outreach-data-tools/notebooks-collection-opendata/HEAD)
                                                 
Note: before starting running the code in the jupyter notebooks, click on the up right button "not trusted" in order to get "trusted" displayed. This should lead the JavaScript to be executed, that is useful to visualise interactive histograms. If that doesn't work, simply go to the top of the notebook, find the cell that contains the line of code `%jsroot` and comment out that.
